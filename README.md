# Portfolio site

A fully responsive website, designed and built by me to present my skills and projects.

The settings menu (upper right hand side) consists of features: dark/light mode and sound effects on/off mode. These settings are stored in a local storage.
The settings menu has also a github link to the code of the project.
There is also a working contact form added to the website.
